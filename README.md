# KenmoreStove-OvenNoHeat

Problem : The Stove wasn't turning on the oven or Broiler

Task : Get the Stove back to turning on the oven and broil 

Action: 1) Measured for  Continuity and resistance  in oven heater 
        2) Measure for Continuity and resistance  in Boiler 
        3) Measure the ohms in the temperature sensor
        4) Inspect the Kenmore Control Board 
       
          # Oven heater 
          - Pass continuity test 
          - 20 ohms 
          
          # Broiler 
          - Pass contiuity test 
          - 20 ohms 
          
          # sensor 
          - 1028 ohms 
          - passed 
          
          # Kenmore Control Board 
          - 240v A/C Relay trace desoldered and with halo effect 
        
Hypothesis: Resolder the trace  in the Control Board and check if the new connection would resolve the problem 

Future Recommendation: Replace Kenmore Control Board
